# Baburam Chaudhary

## Education
- Artificial Intelligence, Masters, Kathmandu University, Dhulikhel, Kavre (Thesis pending, about to finish by a month).
- Electrical Engineering, Bachelors, Institute of Engineering, Pashchimanchal Campus, Pokhara

## Work Experience
**Part time about 6 months, Machine Learning Researcher at RDI, Kathmandu University Dhulikhel, Kavre (2023 second half)**
- Project on Late Blight disease forecasting using Graph Neural Networks.
- My responsibility was to build the deep learning based model based on spatio-temporal graph neural network for weather forecasting for upto a week ahead.
- In the downstream task using the agriculture science domain knowledge, further uses these forecasted weather parameters for predicting the likeliness of the the late blight in potato and tomato.

## Projects
### Machine Learning

Sentiment Analysis I
- sentiment analysis project, done with 'amazon_cells_labelled.txt' dataset, which contains customers review on the product. The target for the sentiment is either positive or negative.
- We got better result in SVC with accuracy of 80.00 %. [Read More](https://github.com/Baburam208/NLP-Projects/tree/main/sentiment%20analysis%20I)

Sentiment Analysis II
- There are three classes in the dataset. We trained the model using SVM and Random Forest. Both gives simimilar result. But for simplicity we opt for SVM.
- Because of weird comments, which do not have any English meanings such as 'linus this is not a table also linus lets use this as a chair' the model accuracy is low.
- Finally, we served the model using FastAPI framework. [Read More](https://github.com/Baburam208/NLP-Projects/tree/main/sentiment%20analysis%20II)

Bank Loan Approval System
- This project can helps to approve loan in a bank. By entering some of the features of the customers', this machine learning model can give decision to whether give approval to the loan or not.
- Model is served using FastAPI framework. [Read More](https://github.com/Baburam208/ML_Projects/tree/main/Bank%20Loan)

NEPSE Stocks Clustering
- We have clustered NEPSE stocks based on the annual return and volatility. And the optimal k was found using the elbow method.

Thyroid Cancer Risk Prediction
- This is a binary classificatin task to predict whether a patient is likely to be thyroid cancer or not using other medical and behavioral or phycical parameters.

### Deep Learning

Snake Identification
- This project will be helpful to recognize the snake, basically five classes of snakes (king cobra, spectacled cobra, common krait, banded krait, and rat snake). 
  We have used pretrained models: VGG16, DenseNet, InceptionV3, and fine-tuned on our own dataset. We got best performance accuracy of 81% in DenseNet.

Facial Expression Recognition
- This project is developed to recognize the facial expression of the people,
specifically 7 type of expression. The dataset used is open source data “FER2013”. I have created graph data
out of the facial landmarks detected by the “Mediapipe” library, used different graph neural network
architectures for the recognition of the expressions.

Weather Forecasting
- We have developed weather forecasting model using Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network (STGCN), which will forecast the weather parameters such as temperature, humidity and pressure using the 14 different wether parameters as input to the model.

### Other Projects

#### Data Analysis (Using SQL)

Retail Sales Analysis
- We have 'Retail Sales Analysis.csv' dataset and we are going to answer some of the questions created by ourself using SQL.
- [Read More](https://github.com/Baburam208/SQL/tree/main/Retail-Sales-Analysis)

E-Commerce Sales Analysis
- We generated custom questions and perform the data analysis on ecommerce sales using SQL.

#### Web Scraping

**These projects are only meant for the educational purpose !!!**

**These are totally a educational purpose project. It is requested to reader to respect the website's terms of service and the robots.txt file while scraping.**

Merojob Scraping
- We used scrapy to scrape 'merojob.com'. We extracted data like title of job, company, location and skills set required. 
- We have used sqlite database to store the scrapped data.
